# House-price-prediction-using-machine-learning
# Project Overview

This project demonstrates a House Price Prediction model built using Python and Machine Learning.
The goal is to predict house prices based on various features such as income, location, and housing characteristics.
The project uses the California Housing Dataset and applies Linear Regression to estimate house prices.
# Problem Statement

Predict the median house price using given housing-related features.
This is a Supervised Machine Learning – Regression problem.
# Dataset

Source: Scikit-learn built-in California Housing Dataset.
Records: 20,640.
Features: 8 numerical features.
Target: Median house price (in $100,000 units).
# Technologies Used

Python,
NumPy,
Pandas,
Scikit-learn,
Matplotlib,
Jupyter Notebook.
# Features Used

Median Income ,
House Age ,
Average Rooms ,
Average Bedrooms ,
Population ,
Average Occupancy ,
Latitude ,
Longitude.
# Project Workflow

1.Load the dataset .
2.Perform data exploration .
3.Split data into training and testing sets .
4.Train a Linear Regression model .
5.Make predictions .
6.Evaluate model performance.
7.Visualize predictions .
# Model Used

Linear Regression :
Linear Regression is used to model the relationship between input features and continuous output (house price).
# Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using:
R² Score ,
Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Example output:
R2 Score: 0.60 ,
Mean Squared Error: 0.52.
# Visualizations

Actual vs Predicted House Prices (Scatter Plot),
Prediction Error Distribution (Histogram),
Line Plot comparison of actual and predicted prices,
These visualizations help in understanding model performance.
